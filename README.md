# Description
In this repository, I explore the use of an ETL pipeline using a STAR schema data design method to create a songs database for a music app. The database will help the music app address business questions regarding its users, including the types of songs they listen to and the artists of those songs, using the available log and song data. The database ensures a consistent and reliable storage solution for this data. This centralized data source is valuable in achieving its analytical objectives, such as identifying the most popular songs.

# Database Design and ETL Pipeline
For the schema design, the STAR schema is used as it simplifies queries and provides fast data aggregations and reporting.
